# Stage 2 Final Exam

This Stage 2 Final Exam will consist of 2 parts:

1. The group presentation to shareholders
2. A Feature Request on an existing application

## Group Presentation

As a group, you will present the GrillBer app to our shareholders. This presentation needs to consist of the following parts:

1. A ***brief*** description of what GrillBer is and why you should use it.
    - Think elevator pitch: this shouldn't be more than two minutes
1. A Live Demo of the application working
1. An overview of the stack the application is running on
    - Front-end technologies
    - Back-end technologies
    - Data technologies
    - Include a diagram of how each part of the stack interacts
1. A sneak peak at the code for any interesting bits
1. A Q&A where shareholders/mentors can ask questions about the app or the technology

### Timing

This presentation shouldn't last longer than 20 minutes. Use your time wisely; hit all the highlights

### Audience

The audience for this project will consist of shareholders for this program, which may include Dan Andrade, Mark Savage, Jim Ries, managers of current participants, Joelle Fronzaglio, Pearse Hutson, and other mentors based on availability.

Because this is a technical presentation, please assume your audience knows technical jargon (jQuery, AJAX, REST, SQL, etc) but be prepared to explain what the jargon means if asked!

## Feature Request

The second part of the Final Exam will be done individually. You will be given the source code to a  mostly working full-stack application, including the following technologies:

- Front-End
    - HTML file
    - CSS file
    - JS file
        - jQuery
- Back-End
    - C#
    - WebAPI
- Data Layer
    - Connection to database

You will then be given a new requirement for this application. You will be expected to implement the new application, making changes at every layer that requires it. There may also be bugs in the existing code that may need to be solved in order to meet the new requirements.

Your final version will be uploaded to GitHub, but should only need to work locally (code does not need to be hosted and is ok to only work against localhost).

You will be graded on the following rubric:

| Criteria | 5 - Exceeds Standard | 3 - Meets Standard | 1 - Below Standard | 
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fulfilled Requirement** | - New feature implemented in many different use cases | - New feature implemented for at least one specific use case | - New feature not implemented |

| **Back-End** | - Excellent use of C# and WebAPI<br> - API endpoints make excellent use of entities and make sense<br> - API is responsive | - Working C# and WebAPI, but unexpected usages<br> - API endpoints use entities<br> - API endpoints take some explanation to make sense<br> - API experiences occasional unexpected lag | - Broken C#/WebAPI<br> - API endpoints don't use meaning entities<br> - API endpoints don't make sense<br> - API experiences unexpected lag
